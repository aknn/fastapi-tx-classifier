   - "groceries and toiletries" ‚Üí Food (1.0 confidence)
   - "DinNER at M&S" ‚Üí Food (1.0 confidence)

## üîß Recommended Improvements

### Priority 1: Critical Category Coverage

```json
// Add to classification_config.json
{
  "category_keywords": {
    "Bills": ["bill", "electricity", "water", "broadband", "council tax", "utility bill"],
    "Rent": ["rent", "landlord", "housing", "tenancy"],
    "Transfer": ["transfer", "savings", "payment to", "contribution", "isa"]
  },
  "overrides": {
    "uber eats delivery": "Food",
    "amazon prime video": "Entertainment",
    "shell gas station": "Transport"
  }
}
```

### Priority 2: Transport Category Refinement

- **Add TfL keywords**: "underground", "tfl", "tube", "bus"
- **Clarify gas station mapping**: Ensure "shell", "bp" ‚Üí Transport not Utilities
- **Handle delivery services**: "uber eats", "deliveroo", "just eat" ‚Üí Food

### Priority 3: Shopping vs Entertainment Disambiguation

- **Streaming services**: "prime video", "disney+", "paramount+" ‚Üí Entertainment
- **Tech purchases**: "apple store", "amazon uk" ‚Üí Shopping (currently working)

## üìà Business Impact Analysis

### For Cheddar Personal Finance Manager

**Positive Impacts:**
- **Food tracking**: 90.9% accuracy enables reliable dining/grocery insights
- **Shopping analysis**: 80% accuracy good for major purchase tracking
- **Entertainment spending**: 80% accuracy sufficient for subscription monitoring

**Risk Areas:**
- **Bill categorization**: 0% accuracy means utilities won't be tracked properly
- **Rent tracking**: 0% accuracy critical for housing expense analysis
- **Transfer detection**: 0% accuracy affects savings/investment insights

**User Experience Impact:**
- Users would need to manually correct ~33% of transactions
- High confidence scores (0.8+) could auto-approve corrections
- Low confidence scores (<0.8) should prompt user verification

## üöÄ Next Steps for Production

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
1. **Expand keyword coverage** for missing categories
2. **Add critical overrides** for known misclassifications
3. **Implement confidence-based user prompts**

### Medium Term (1-2 months)
1. **A/B test ML hybrid approach** for transactions with confidence < 0.8
2. **Implement user feedback loop** to improve classifications
3. **Add fuzzy matching** for merchant name variations

### Long Term (3-6 months)
1. **Deploy ensemble model** (rules + ML)
2. **Implement real-time learning** from user corrections
3. **Add contextual features** (amount ranges, time patterns)
